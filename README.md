## Environment Variables

In order for the app to function correctly, the user must set up their own environment variables.

create a .env file that includes the following:
  
 _ DATABASE_URL - This is the url for thre Groa database needed to connect to our postgresQL on RDS
_ TESTING_DB_URL - This is the local test databaase url, it can be changed to whatever you need for your local setup
_ RECOMMENDATION_URL - This is the url for the data science ratings recommender, needed for generating recommendations
_ JWT_SECRET - The secret used to assign encode tokens for authentication
_ TOKEN_EXP - Variable in which the token expires, can be set to anything you like
_ HASHING_ROUNDS - adds rounds to the hashing

The respective values for these variables can be found on the Elastic Beanstalk environment in Configuration > Software > Environment properties
